#  Smart Indoor Air Quality Monitoring System using Arduino

This project is a real-time indoor air quality (IAQ) monitoring system developed using an Arduino Uno and programmed in C. It integrates a gas sensor, an LCD display, and an RGB LED to provide multi-stage visual and audible alerts based on air quality. The entire system is simulated in the Tinkercad Circuits environment.

### ‚ú® Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously reads data from the MQ135 gas sensor.
- **Live Data Display:** Shows the current air quality in Parts Per Million (PPM) on a 16x2 LCD screen.
- **Multi-Stage Visual Alerts:** An RGB LED provides instant, color-coded status updates:
  - üü¢ **Green:** Good
  - üîµ **Blue:** Moderate
  - üî¥ **Red:** Poor / Danger
- **Audible Alarm:** A buzzer sounds an alarm when air quality reaches critical levels.
- **Manual Override:** A pushbutton allows for immediate, on-demand sensor readings.
